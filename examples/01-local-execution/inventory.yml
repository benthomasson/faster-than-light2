# No SSH connection is used - modules run directly on this machine.

all:
  hosts:
    localhost:
      # Connection type: local (no SSH)
      ansible_connection: local

      # Python interpreter for module execution
      # Update this path if your Python is located elsewhere
      ansible_python_interpreter: /usr/bin/python3

      # Optional variables for testing
      vars:
        environment: development
        example_var: "This is a test variable"
